# The exploit for the truly desperate
Disable WP on CR50 devices without opening it, just requires a chromebook in devmode and a ton of time.
If you get an auth code, create an issue with the related info, or even better, send a DM to @crossystem or @thetechfrog on discord

# Instructions:
On an **UNENROLLED CHROMEBOOK** IN DEVMODE with WP and WIFI ON run
```
curl -Lk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Whelement/CRSH1TTY-public-beta/main/archive/crsh1ttyb1.sh -o ./crsh1ttyb1.sh && bash ./crsh1ttyb1.sh
```
in vt2, and just wait!

# Disclaimer: 
We do not have an auth code as of right now, and we are hoping that opening this up to the public will help us find more codes. This is not the final product, just a beta! Also, don't bother reporting this to Google as they won't care.

<sup>(note: we have a single auth code, however, it was not generated by us, and was found online by TheTechFrog)</sup>
